      <h2>About Live Church Solutions</h2>
      <p>In 2012 we came together with the initial goal of forming a new church in the Houston area. While looking into this goal we discovered that Houston did not really need one more church, but rather the existing churches in Houston needed help to be more effective in their ministry. Especially in the area of technology.</p>
      <p>We set up Live Church Solutions as a 501(c)(3) in 2012 with the goal of helping small churches with their technical needs. Those exact needs change over time as technology changes, however our mission has remained the same. We want to be your ministry partner, helping to offload the various technical challenges churches face so that you can focus on what matters, ministering to your congregation and community.</p>
      <p>We have built a number of free and open-source solutions to help you with some of the common challenges such as getting a website online, live streaming and tracking key information such as attendance, membership and giving. We also work closely with churches to provide guidance in these and other areas such as AV and network configurations.</p>
      <p>We know budgets are tight in churches and never want that to be a barrier to implementing solutions that will empower others to share the gospel more effectively. That is why we never charge for any of the services we offer. All of our services are provided 100% free of charge.</p>
