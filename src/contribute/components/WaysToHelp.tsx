      <p>With a primary goal of producing open-source software for churches, we always need developers.  Most of our projects utilize a MERN stack (MySQL, Express, React, Node), with the mobile apps using React Native.  Even if you lack experience in these solutions, there are other development opportunities that are vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript, testing and DevOps.</p>
