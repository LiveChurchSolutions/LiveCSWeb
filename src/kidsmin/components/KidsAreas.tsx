                <h2>What Exactly Do We Do?</h2>
                <p>We are very methodical in our approach, making sure nothing gets overlooked. We'll start by discussing your current situation..... We'll then put together a plan addressing following items and help you implement it over the next several months.</p>

                <ul className="checkList">
                    <li><b>Volunteers</b> - We will help you learn how to recognize potential volunteers and how to approach them about serving. We will also help you build a volunteer training program and show you how to ensure your volunteers don’t get burned out.</li>
                    <li><b>Safety</b> - We will help you address all aspects of child safety from developing protocols, showing you how to perform background checks, how to implement a free state of the art child checkin system, to how to ensure children only go home with authorized parents.</li>
                    <li><b>Cirriculum</b> - We'll show you some great options for free or budget friendly children's curriculum. and help you find music and games that keep the kids engaged  that are fun for both kids and volunteers.</li>
                    <li><b>Burnout</b> - Unfortunately burnout is a real problem. Most of the time being a CM is the most misunderstood job in the church. Along with that, it can be easy to reach burnout. Often the CM’s burnout will effect their team as well so it is good to learn how to monitor your own burnout as well as those around you. We can help you learn to recognize the signs and what to do when it happens.</li>
                    <li><b>Partnering with Parents</b> - This is the  key in having a ministry that will out last any leader and have the biggest impact on your church and the Church as a whole. However, it is also probably the single hardest thing to accomplish. We do not have all the answers but are always working on creative ways to make this happen.</li>
